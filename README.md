## Part 1: tell us about your experience.

## 1. Guide us about a couple projects in recent years on the ones you think your team added considerable value to the company:

### Summary

As an executive for Data and Analytics in a consultancy firm, I participated in different relevant projects, I belive that the most remarkable ptrojects are one of them for telecomunications sector, and it is remarkable because the goal was deliverd and data engineering solution in order to monitoring network in real time, was very challenge because solution must perform more than 2 millon of events per second, all data architecture setup was deploy in AWS, I remember some of the components that team use for ingest NiFi, for events engine and measure metrics a low latency framework like Flink, for delivering data streams Kafka, for persits data in memory Apache Druid and for visualization in real time Apache superset. With these stack tech we deliverded more than 100 kpis in real time in 6 months.

Another main project is for industry 4.0, was an amazing experience because the first challenge was start a migration strategy to the cloud technology, in this ocasion the team use Microsoft Azure (DataLake, Databricks, Containers, AKS), and all stack technology should has the capability of ingest more than 20 terabytes daily becasue different sensors across the plant generates a lot of data, this was the first challenge, the second challenge was delivered a machine learning as a service platform for predective maintenace on different line of service, after ingestion process the data scientists create de analytical models, then our machine learning engineers industrialize those models as a service and predict time to failure near real time given differents events. We got amazing results because we prevent a failure and reduce downtime in a production line. Depends of the production line but we save cost from 10K to 50K usd per month in different production lines.

Another one more project was for a global digital payment technology company, they required an assesment in order to evolutionate from data driven company into an insigth driven company. We must evaluate different aspects of data maturity model like data strategy, data governace, data platforms and advaced analytics use cases. Delivered a roadmap with the rigth projects for carrying company to the next level in data and analytics, in Data Governace (Data Quality, Data profiling, Data Security, Metadata Management), for Analytics (Mahcine Learning as a service, containers, MLOps, DataOPs), Real time data platforms and advanced visualization (BI Platforms of new generation).

All projects leaved us grown in a sustetability way from 30 to 70 head count, we generated recurrent project, incrementals, evolutives in data and analytics that comes with an important income revenue, with healthy contract  margin for the busineess unit.

### a. What needs of the company did these projects address?
As a consultancy firm we attend many companies in their digital transformation with data and analytics projects

### b. How were these needs detected?
We made and assesment for all our client in order to understand data from the strategy to the use cases, their type of data, governance, data platform and data architecture

### c. How did the team work to solve these needs?
Depends of the challenge, we have an a succesful database of cases with complete documentation and experience in different technologies for different cloud vendors in data and analytics. Team must learn and undestand challenge and technology, then the could design better aproach for different use case

- ### i. What was the structure of the team?
Head of Data & Analytics(Director), two Managers, 5 Experts Data Engineers, 15 Leaders and aprox. 50 staff consultants

- ### ii. What roles were involved with which responsibilities?
We have at differnet levels Data Engineers, Data Architects, Data Scientists, Data Analytsts, Machine Learning Engineers

- ### iii. What was your role in the team?
Head of Data & Analytics(Director)

- ### iv. What was the collaboration with other teams like?
Strategy, Digital Architecture (APIs & Micorservices), Digital Experience, sinergy with them in order to delivered solutions end to end with user experience and scalability

- ### v. What was the work done, and the deliverables?
- KPIs in real time
- Machine Learning as a Service in a world class data platform
- Data Driven Company Assesment

### d. What was your involvement in these projects?
Undestand challenges in each client, propose better approaches and define the right team for each challenge in order to delivered on time and quality

- ### i. What was your collaboration with other stakeholders like?
Identify the data strategy, and measure the rigth KPI for each initiative based on data

- ### ii. What was your collaboration with your team like?
Great, reduce attrition in my management period, team got new certificates and growth in data technologies, cloud technologies and analytics 

### e. How did you measure the results delivered by your team?
Depends of the project, we consider different KPI for different approaches like, customer, Marketing, Finance, Retail, social media, etc

### f. What were the outcomes for the company of your team’s work?

- More than 100 kpis in real time in 6 months in one company
- Save cost from 10K to 50K usd per month
- New projects for data and analytics in the trhee mayor cloud tehcnologies


## 2. Guide us through situations where your team had to work with reporting and analytical needs:
