# KueskiChallenge

## Part 1: tell us about your experience.

### 1. Guide us about a couple projects in recent years on the ones you think your team added considerable value to the company:

As an executive for Data and Analytics in a consultancy firm, I participated in different relevant projects, I belive that the most remarkable ptrojects are one of them for telecomunications sector, and it is remarkable because the goal was deliverd and data engineering solution in order to monitoring network in real time, was very challenge because solution must perform more than 2 millon of events per second, all data architecture setup was deploy in AWS, I remember some of the components that team use for ingest NiFi, for events engine and measure metrics a low latency framework like Flink, for delivering data streams Kafka, for persits data in memory Apache Druid and for visualization in real time Apache superset. With these stack tech we deliverded more than 100 kpis in real time in 6 months.

Another main project is for industry 4.0, was an amazing experience because the first challenge was start a migration strategy to the cloud technology, in this ocasion the team use Microsoft Azure (DataLake, Databricks, Containers, AKS), and all stack technology should has the capability of ingest more than 20 terabytes daily becasue different sensors across the plant generates a lot of data, this was the first challenge the second challenge was delivered a machine learning as a service platform for predective maintenace on different line of service, after ingestion procees the data scientists create de analytical models, then our machine learning engineers industrialize those models as a service and predict time to failure near real time given differents events. We got amazing results becasuse prevent a failure reduce downtime in a production line, depends of the production line but we save cost from 10K to 50K usd per month.

Another one more project was for a global digital payment technology company, they required an assesment in order to evolutionate from data driven company into an insigth driven company. We must evaluate different aspects of data maturity model like data strategy, data governace, data platforms and advaced analytics use cases. Delivered a roadmap with the rigth projects for carrying company to the next level in data and analytics, in Data Governace (Data Quality, Data profiling, Data Security, Metadata Management), for Analytics (Mahcine Learning as a service, containers, MLOps, DataOPs), Real time data platforms and advanced visualization (BI Platforms of new generation).

All projects leaved us grown in a sustetability way from 30 to 70 head count, we generated recurrent project, incrementals, evolutives in data and analytics that comes with an important income revenue, with healthy contract  margin for the busineess unit.
