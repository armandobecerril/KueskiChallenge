# KueskiChallenge

## Part 1: tell us about your experience.

## 1. Guide us about a couple projects in recent years on the ones you think your team added considerable value to the company:

### Summary

As an executive for Data and Analytics in a consultancy firm, I participated in different relevant projects, I belive that the most remarkable ptrojects are one of them for telecomunications sector, and it is remarkable because the goal was deliverd and data engineering solution in order to monitoring network in real time, was very challenge because solution must perform more than 2 millon of events per second, all data architecture setup was deploy in AWS, I remember some of the components that team use for ingest NiFi, for events engine and measure metrics a low latency framework like Flink, for delivering data streams Kafka, for persits data in memory Apache Druid and for visualization in real time Apache superset. With these stack tech we deliverded more than 100 kpis in real time in 6 months.

Another main project is for industry 4.0, was an amazing experience because the first challenge was start a migration strategy to the cloud technology, in this ocasion the team use Microsoft Azure (DataLake, Databricks, Containers, AKS), and all stack technology should has the capability of ingest more than 20 terabytes daily becasue different sensors across the plant generates a lot of data, this was the first challenge, the second challenge was delivered a machine learning as a service platform for predective maintenace on different line of service, after ingestion process the data scientists create de analytical models, then our machine learning engineers industrialize those models as a service and predict time to failure near real time given differents events. We got amazing results because we prevent a failure and reduce downtime in a production line. Depends of the production line but we save cost from 10K to 50K usd per month in different production lines.

Another one more project was for a global digital payment technology company, they required an assesment in order to evolutionate from data driven company into an insigth driven company. We must evaluate different aspects of data maturity model like data strategy, data governace, data platforms and advaced analytics use cases. Delivered a roadmap with the rigth projects for carrying company to the next level in data and analytics, in Data Governace (Data Quality, Data profiling, Data Security, Metadata Management), for Analytics (Mahcine Learning as a service, containers, MLOps, DataOPs), Real time data platforms and advanced visualization (BI Platforms of new generation).

All projects leaved us grown in a sustetability way from 30 to 70 head count, we generated recurrent project, incrementals, evolutives in data and analytics that comes with an important income revenue, with healthy contract  margin for the busineess unit.

## 4. Tell us about the organizational structures you have implemented for your teams in the past:

Mainly in different approaches and necessities, form traditional Business Intelligence, relational data bases, and ad-hoc reports to the new disruptive technologies that makes the difference in digital technology like big data and fast data, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence, data governace and advanced visualizations, needs are different and a multidiciplinary team with good softskills but with excellence in hard skills are required for a succesful projects 

### a. Did your team work in a centralized manner? That is, receiving requests from other teams via a single channel and prioritizing internally.
Not, we dont. We belive that we must think and make the work different, with innovation labs, traninig paths and certification paths, evolving talent, data assets all global experience are shared with different teams, given that, all oficial requirements pass througth the executive company commitee before evaluate and perform

### b. Did your team work in a hybrid manner? That is, engineers working as part of business or product teams, but at the same time being part of a core data team in charge of their career path, development of technical skills and soft skills, etc.
Yes, it is necessary in order to improve professional maturity, however it is import consider and evaluate that each person is faster in maturity than others. We decided who is ready for more duties and responsabilities given their maturity

Provide experience and definition of traning paths and certifications paths, hired the rigth team in different levels taking advantage of my networking 

### d. What were the advantages and disadvantages of the implemented team’s structure?
Well, it is a real problem try to keep all professionals happy, most part of them want to become a data scientist, but they dont have robust maths and statistics in a professional way. This disadvantages is more notoried in youger consultants

## 5. Could you share with us an experience where things didn’t go well?

### a. What didn’t go well?
My antecesor hired a supposed expert in visualization with the skills of REACT and python, we needed to deliver several indicators in a real time dashboards, that the tool doesnt have in a native manner for build those KPI, the idea was hire and expert in order to  improved the capabilities of visualization tool. Unfortunaly the supposed expert failed in all taks that must performed, he didn't have exprience and enough knowledge of the technology

### b. What was the impact?
Several impacts of delivery time,  image of the company that comes with financial impacts too.

### c. Was there a positive outcome of that experience?
New hired process, more extensive and with different professionals in some cases with exams if is necessary

## Part 2: business case

### Problem description:

Suppose you are leading a team that is in charge of delivering data solutions end to end. It
means that your team is in charge of ingesting the data until delivering metrics results to the
company.

Now, imagine that you are working on a stock market analysis company that provides basic
information for investors. The request is to deliver report metrics based on the historical
stock prices. It is a common practice to perform stock analysis based on moving averages
from different time windows E.g 30 days, 15 days and 7 days (you don’t have to perform
those).

The historical data is received daily and we have to deliver daily metrics in order to make
decisions. The sample of historical data can be found here (you need to register/log in in
order to download the data file).
https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/daily-historical-stock-prices-1970-2018#historical_stock_pr
ices.csv.

You have to build an end to end solution to deliver the stock prices metrics.

1. How does the architecture would look like?
2. How can you ensure the quality of the data?
3. Would you apply data modeling techniques?
a. How would you model the data?
b. Why would you use that model?
4. How would you deliver metrics results?
5. How would you present the data so it is understandable by everyone?
6. How can you ensure that the metrics delivered are consistent?
7. What if we have to add a new time window of 45 days?

Imagine the project was successful and investors are buying and selling stocks every
second. There is a necessity for visualizing all the transactions done by investors in real
time. You can assume the data is coming in streaming and is your team's job to process the
data and deliver aggregates E.g purchases & sales by investor and by stock.

1. Mention the data stack you would use to achieve this necessity.
2. How would you apply data analysis in real time?
3. How would you ensure the process is stable?
4. What do you think would be the responsibility of the analysis team?
5. Mention the main challenges you may face when implementing streaming solutions.
