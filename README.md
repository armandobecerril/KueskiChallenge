# KueskiChallenge

## Part 1: tell us about your experience.

## 1. Guide us about a couple projects in recent years on the ones you think your team added considerable value to the company:

### Summary

As an executive for Data and Analytics in a consultancy firm, I participated in different relevant projects, I belive that the most remarkable ptrojects are one of them for telecomunications sector, and it is remarkable because the goal was deliverd and data engineering solution in order to monitoring network in real time, was very challenge because solution must perform more than 2 millon of events per second, all data architecture setup was deploy in AWS, I remember some of the components that team use for ingest NiFi, for events engine and measure metrics a low latency framework like Flink, for delivering data streams Kafka, for persits data in memory Apache Druid and for visualization in real time Apache superset. With these stack tech we deliverded more than 100 kpis in real time in 6 months.

Another main project is for industry 4.0, was an amazing experience because the first challenge was start a migration strategy to the cloud technology, in this ocasion the team use Microsoft Azure (DataLake, Databricks, Containers, AKS), and all stack technology should has the capability of ingest more than 20 terabytes daily becasue different sensors across the plant generates a lot of data, this was the first challenge, the second challenge was delivered a machine learning as a service platform for predective maintenace on different line of service, after ingestion process the data scientists create de analytical models, then our machine learning engineers industrialize those models as a service and predict time to failure near real time given differents events. We got amazing results because we prevent a failure and reduce downtime in a production line. Depends of the production line but we save cost from 10K to 50K usd per month in different production lines.

Another one more project was for a global digital payment technology company, they required an assesment in order to evolutionate from data driven company into an insigth driven company. We must evaluate different aspects of data maturity model like data strategy, data governace, data platforms and advaced analytics use cases. Delivered a roadmap with the rigth projects for carrying company to the next level in data and analytics, in Data Governace (Data Quality, Data profiling, Data Security, Metadata Management), for Analytics (Mahcine Learning as a service, containers, MLOps, DataOPs), Real time data platforms and advanced visualization (BI Platforms of new generation).

All projects leaved us grown in a sustetability way from 30 to 70 head count, we generated recurrent project, incrementals, evolutives in data and analytics that comes with an important income revenue, with healthy contract  margin for the busineess unit.

- Strategy (Why)
- Use Cases (What)
- Governance (Who, When, How)

## 4. Tell us about the organizational structures you have implemented for your teams in the past:

Mainly in different approaches and necessities, form traditional Business Intelligence, relational data bases, and ad-hoc reports to the new disruptive technologies that makes the difference in digital technology like big data and fast data, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence, data governace and advanced visualizations, needs are different and a multidiciplinary team with good softskills but with excellence in hard skills are required for a succesful projects 

### a. Did your team work in a centralized manner? That is, receiving requests from other teams via a single channel and prioritizing internally.
Not, we dont. We belive that we must think and make the work different, with innovation labs, traninig paths and certification paths, evolving talent, data assets all global experience are shared with different teams, given that, all oficial requirements pass througth the executive company commitee before evaluate and perform

Provide experience and definition of traning paths and certifications paths, hired the rigth team in different levels taking advantage of my networking 

### d. What were the advantages and disadvantages of the implemented team’s structure?
Well, it is a real problem try to keep all professionals happy, most part of them want to become a data scientist, but they dont have robust maths and statistics in a professional way. This disadvantages is more notoried in youger consultants

## 5. Could you share with us an experience where things didn’t go well?
